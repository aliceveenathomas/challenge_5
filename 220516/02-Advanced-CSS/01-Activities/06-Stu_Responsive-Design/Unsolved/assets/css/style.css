What happens when we set the display property to flex? 
TODO: Write your answer here 
As soon as you set the display property to flex, 
the unordered list automatically becomes the flex container 
and the child elements (in this case, the list elements li) 
become flex items. These terms would come up over and over 
again as I walk you through some more interesting things 
the Flexbox model has in place.

flex-basis. The second and third parameters ( flex-shrink and 
flex-basis) are optional.
